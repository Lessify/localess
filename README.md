    subgraph Firebase
      direction LR
      auth["Authentication"]
      storage["Storage"]
      firestore["Firestore"]
      functions["Functions"]
      host["Host"]
    end
    cdn -->|API| Firebase
  end
  subgraph Global Internet
    adminUI["Localess Admin UI<br/>(Browser)"]
    mobileApp["Mobile App<br/>(iOS, Android)"]
    webApp["Web App<br/>(Browser)"]
    serverApp["Server App<br/>(NodeJS, Java/Kotlin, <br/>Python, Rust, Go)"]
  end
  adminUI -->|Manage Data| Firebase
  mobileApp -->|Access Data via API| cdn
  webApp -->|Access Data via API| cdn
  serverApp -->|Access Data via API| cdn
```

Lessify UI is design to manage data in firestore, authentication and storage via Firebase SDK.
Generated data used by exposed API's is store in Storage to make it even faster to access and GCP CDN will cache it for even faster response.
