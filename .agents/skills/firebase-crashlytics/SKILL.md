# Crashlytics

This skill provides a complete guide for getting started with Crashlytics on Android or iOS. Crash data collected from client applications can be read using the MCP server in the Firebase CLI.

## Prerequisites

Provisioning Crashlytics requires both a Firebase project and a Firebase app, either Android or iOS. To read the data collected by Crashlytics, install the MCP server in the Firebase CLI. See the `firebase-basics` skill for references.

## SDK Setup

To learn how to setup Crashlytics in your application code, choose your platform:

*   **Android**: [android_setup.md](references/android_setup.md)
*   **iOS**: [ios_setup.md](references/ios_setup.md)

## SDK Usage

The SDK provides a number of features to make crash reports more actionable.

* Add custom keys
* Add custom logs
