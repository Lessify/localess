It offers much better compression than PNG or JPEG with support for higher color depths, animated frames, transparency, etc. Note that when using AVIF, you should include fallbacks to formats with better browser support. Supported: Chrome, Firefox (still images only: animated images not implemented), Opera, Safari.',
  '.gif': 'Good choice for simple images and animations. Prefer PNG for lossless and indexed still images, and consider WebP, AVIF or APNG for animation sequences. Supported: Chrome, Edge, Firefox, IE, Opera, Safari.',

  '.svg': 'Vector image format; ideal for user interface elements, icons, diagrams, etc., that must be drawn accurately at different sizes. Support: Chrome, Edge, Firefox, IE, Opera, Safari.',
  '.webp': 'Excellent choice for both images and animated images. WebP offers much better compression than PNG or JPEG with support for higher color depths, animated frames, transparency etc. AVIF offers slightly better compression, but is not quite as well-supported in browsers and does not support progressive rendering.
